// Vertex - Node
// Egde - Connection

// Undirected - Graph where edges connect to each other where both nodes can "access" each other Example Facebook friends.
//  Directed - Graph where egdes are one directional Example: instagram followers

//  Weighted Graph - Edges have values 
//  Unweighter Graph - Egdes are just connections with no value associated with them

// Adjecency Matrix - Can take more space, slower traverse, faster lookup for specific edge
// Adjecency List - Can take less space, faster to traverse, slow lookup time for specific edge
